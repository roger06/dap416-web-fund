Specialised tools

easy for everyone

mindset, motivation, goals

Spectrum
hearing issues
Sight issues - blind / partially sighted
Motor skills - arthritis

Colour
    helps distinguish one thing from another (graphs etc - use shape or patterns) - don't need to remove colour but don't rely on it. This helps everyone
    
    Names with colours

Access. - Design at the start of the projetc rather than adding them later.



Contrast

use an online checker - 

Animation / motion
can create engagement / excitement

vestibular disorder - balance , vertigo, dizziness - parallax effect = https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_css_parallax_demo.htm

don't rely on animation

Proximity / grouping    
    
    'straw test' - (vision like looking through a straw) - limted field of view - 
        
    e.g. visual feedback on or near what you're doing - e.g. on the add to cart button, not on the other side of the page
    

Keyboard navigation
    You must be able to complete all tasks using a keyboard - this should be the very first test you do
    
    tab, enter, arrow keys, spacebar
    blind - can't see mouse pointer
    can see but using mouse is painful ('sighted keyboard user') - demo help site
    
    use outline: none; in CSS ? then use own :focus
    https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_dim_width_inputfocus
    
    You can only tab to links (so not divs) - the function of the interface - so paragrpahs don''t need to be selectable with keyboard
    
    Auto tabbing with JS - can cause problems when reviewing or re-entering data
    
Flow of content
    screen readers read in the order of the source
    
Touch devices
    target size - some may tap with nose or feet
    
Audio and video
    
    Images - text euqivalent if meaning of page is affected without it
    
    Podcast - publish transcript.
    
    Images one of three > Information : functional : decorative???
    
Forms
    every form element needs a <label>
    
    aria label
    
    placeholder
    
    HTML5 specific form types - recogised as 'different' by a phone OS - so keyboard will adapt to the input (numeric for phone number?, email shows @ and . )
    
    think about placement of error messages
